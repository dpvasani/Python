# 🧠 Python Scope & Closures – Zero to Hero Guide

---

## 🧩 1. What is Scope in Python?

### 📌 **Definition**:

Scope refers to **which part of the program can access a variable**.

### 🗂️ Types of Scope:

Python uses the **LEGB Rule** for scope resolution:

| 🔤 Scope          | 💡 Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **L** (Local)     | Inside the current function                          |
| **E** (Enclosing) | Inside any enclosing function (for nested functions) |
| **G** (Global)    | At the top-level of the module                       |
| **B** (Built-in)  | Python’s built-in names (like `len`, `range`, etc)   |

---

## 📦 2. Local vs Global Variables

```python
x = 10  # 🌐 Global variable

def example():
    x = 5  # 📍 Local variable
    print(x)

example()   # Output: 5
print(x)    # Output: 10
```

🔎 Python uses **the nearest defined variable** by default.

---

## 🔄 3. The `global` Keyword

To modify a global variable inside a function:

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)  # Output: 1
```

⚠️ Avoid overusing `global`. It makes code harder to debug 🔧

---

## 🧭 4. Nested Functions & Enclosing Scope

```python
def outer():
    message = "Hello"

    def inner():
        print(message)

    inner()

outer()
```

✔️ `inner()` can access `message` from `outer()` even though it's not defined inside it.

This is **Enclosing Scope**!

---

## 🎯 5. The `nonlocal` Keyword

`nonlocal` lets us **modify a variable from the enclosing function**.

```python
def outer():
    count = 0

    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print("Inner count:", count)

    inner()
    print("Outer count:", count)

outer()
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Inner count: 1
Outer count: 1
```

---

## 🧙‍♂️ 6. What is a Closure?

A **closure** is a function that **remembers values** from its **enclosing lexical scope**, even if that scope is no longer active.

### 📦 Closure = Function + Enclosing State

---

### 🧪 Example of a Closure:

```python
def make_multiplier(x):
    def multiplier(n):
        return x * n
    return multiplier

times3 = make_multiplier(3)
print(times3(5))  # Output: 15
```

🔍 Even though `x` is gone (function `make_multiplier` has finished), `times3` still **remembers** that `x = 3`. That’s closure.

---

## 🔍 7. How to Identify a Closure?

### ✅ A function must:

1. Be **nested inside another function**
2. **Use a variable** from the enclosing function
3. Be **returned from the outer function**

---

## 🧰 8. Use Cases of Closures

| 🧠 Use Case            | 📄 Description                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation**      | Hide variables from global scope           |
| **Callback functions** | Useful in decorators, UI events            |
| **Factory functions**  | Functions that return customized functions |

---

## 🧪 Real-life Analogy:

Imagine a chef 👨‍🍳 (inner function) trained in a specific kitchen 🏡 (outer function). Even if the kitchen closes, the chef retains the recipe 📝. That recipe is the closure.

---

## ⚙️ 9. Advanced Closure Behavior

Closures maintain **state** without using classes:

```python
def counter():
    count = 0
    def increment():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return increment

c = counter()
print(c())  # 1
print(c())  # 2
```

Each call remembers the updated `count`. That’s closure magic ✨

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfall

### ❌ Problem:

```python
def bad_closures():
    funcs = []
    for i in range(3):
        def inner():
            return i
        funcs.append(inner)
    return funcs

closures = bad_closures()
print([f() for f in closures])  # ❌ Output: [2, 2, 2]
```

### ✅ Fix using default arguments:

```python
def good_closures():
    funcs = []
    for i in range(3):
        def inner(i=i):  # 🛠️ capture i at that time
            return i
        funcs.append(inner)
    return funcs

closures = good_closures()
print([f() for f in closures])  # ✅ Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

## 🧠 10. Summary (Zero ➡️ Hero)

| Concept       | Learnings                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔍 Scope      | LEGB Rule: Local → Enclosing → Global → Built-in |
| 🧪 Local      | Variable inside function                         |
| 🌐 Global     | Variable outside all functions                   |
| 🧩 Enclosing  | For nested functions                             |
| 🔓 `global`   | Modify global variable from inside               |
| 🔄 `nonlocal` | Modify enclosing variable in nested function     |
| 🧠 Closure    | Function + enclosed state                        |
| 🛠️ Use       | Factory functions, decorators, encapsulation     |

---

## 📚 Bonus: Python `inspect` closure

To inspect closures:

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    def inner():
        return x
    return inner

func = outer()
print(func.__closure__[0].cell_contents)  # Output: 10
```

---

## ✅ Final Thought:

Closures are **powerful**, **clean**, and **memory-efficient** tools in Python 🔥
They allow you to write flexible code without needing to create classes every time 🧰
