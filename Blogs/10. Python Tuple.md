# **🐍 Python Tuple: Scratch to Pro**

---

## 📌 What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Once created, you cannot change the elements.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

### ✅ Key Features

* Ordered 📦
* Immutable 🔒
* Allows duplicates ✅
* Can store mixed data types 🔢📄

---

## ✨ Tuple Creation

```python
empty = ()  # empty tuple
one_item = (5,)  # MUST have comma for single item
mixed = (1, 'Hello', 3.14, True)
nested = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
```

### Without Parentheses

```python
my_tuple = 1, 2, 3  # also a tuple
```

---

## 📚 Accessing Elements

```python
t = (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(t[0])   # 10
print(t[-1])  # 40 (last element)
```

---

## 🔁 Looping Through Tuple

```python
for item in t:
    print(item)
```

---

## 🔍 Tuple Operations

```python
len(t)             # ➡️ 4
t + (50, 60)       # ➡️ Concatenation
t * 2              # ➡️ (10, 20, 30, 40, 10, 20, 30, 40)
30 in t            # ➡️ True
```

---

## 🛠️ Tuple Methods

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
t.count(2)   # ➡️ 3 (occurrence)
t.index(3)   # ➡️ 2 (first occurrence index)
```

---

## 🎯 Immutability

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t[0] = 10  # ❌ Error! Tuples can't be modified
```

---

## 📦 Tuple Packing & Unpacking

```python
# Packing
person = ("Darshan", 21, "Developer")

# Unpacking
a, b, c = person
print(a)  # Darshan
```

---

## 🧠 When to Use Tuples?

* Data that shouldn't change 📜
* As dictionary keys 🔑
* Faster than lists for fixed data 🏃‍♂️💨
* Return multiple values from functions 🎯

---

## 🔄 Convert Between List & Tuple

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
tuple1 = tuple(list1)

new_list = list(tuple1)
```

---

## 🧊 Nested Tuples & Access

```python
data = (("Math", 90), ("Science", 85))
print(data[0][1])  # ➡️ 90
```

## 🔥 Tuple vs List

| Feature     | Tuple       | List         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Mutable     | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes        |
| Syntax      | `(1, 2, 3)` | `[1, 2, 3]`  |
| Performance | ✅ Faster    | ❌ Slower     |
| Methods     | Limited     | Rich Methods |

## 🧪 Mini Project: Return Multiple Values

```python
def min_max(nums):
    return (min(nums), max(nums))

result = min_max([10, 5, 8])
print("Min:", result[0])
print("Max:", result[1])
```
